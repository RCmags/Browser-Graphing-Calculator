# Graphing-Calculator
This is a basic graphing calculator implemented in Javascript and meant to be run from a web browser.
The under can plot up to 3 curves at the same time and can also control the location of the graph they want to investigate. That is, they can scroll the graph about the X and Y axis, or increase or decrease the scale of the axes (zooming effect).
