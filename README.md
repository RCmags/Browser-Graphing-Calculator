# Graphing-Calculator
This is a basic graphing calculator implemented in Javascript and is meant to be run from a web browser. The user can plot up to 3 equations at the same time, and they can also translate or zoom in or out the field of view.  

To use the calculator, simply open the "project.html" file with a web browser.
